# mobile-robotic-arm
This project designs a 5-DOF mobile robotic arm controlled wirelessly via ESP32 and Bluetooth using a smartphone app built on Kodular. It performs real-time pick-and-place tasks with servo/DC motors, showcasing embedded systems, wireless control, and robotics in a low-cost, modular, and scalable setup.
